# chatbot Edgar
Edgar is an experimental chatbot created with P5, ML5 and javascript. It uses a deep learning algorithm to identify the user intentions, and then respond accordingly. 
The next step is to explore the possibility to implement a sort of genetic algorithm to build the correct response from a pool of possible responses.
